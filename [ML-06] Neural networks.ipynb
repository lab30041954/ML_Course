    "**Neural networks** are as old as artificial intelligence itself, and the expectations about what neural networks could do have experimented up and downs along 60 years. Right now, they are very high. Neural networks and, more specifically, a special type of neural network models, the **transformer**, are taking over machine learning. As more use cases are reported for the new models, expectations about the power of artificial intelligence keep growing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A neural network can be thought as an interconnected set of computational **nodes** or neurons, organized in **layers**. In the network, every connection of a node to another node has a **weight**. Machine learning happens when these weights are learned from data. The way the nodes are connected in a neural network was initially inspired by ideas about how neurons work together in the brain. Though this is no longer true in most neural network models, in particular in transformers, the discussion about the similarities between the two domains is still alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of neural networks. This lecture is restricted to the **multilayer perceptron** (MLP) model, which has been the standard approach for many years. In the next lecture, we will introduce more complex architectures, which we call **deep learning** models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the idea of the neural network as a mathematical model for the brain (which it is not) was attractive, we regard nowadays a neural network as a mathematical function, which takes an input and returns an output. Both the input and the output are **tensors**. A tensor is the same as a NumPy array (though in Python they are different types of objects). So, a 0D tensor is a scalar (a number), a 1D tensor is a vector, a 2D tensor is a matrix, etc. Most of the operations performed with the tensors in a neural network are just linear algebra. We use the package **Keras** in the examples (more detail below)."

    "* *How to find the optimal weights*. Initially, the weights are randomly assigned. Then, an iterative process starts. At every step, the prediction is performed with the current weights, the value of a **loss function** is calculated, and the weights are adjusted in order to reduce the loss. The process is expected to converge to an optimal solution, but, in practice, a maximum number of passes is pre-specified. In regression, the loss is usually the MSE, while, in classification, it is the average cross-entropy (Keras uses natural logs to calculate it). The adjustment of the weights starts at the last layer, and continues backwards until the input layer. This is called **backpropagation**.\n",

    "* *The optimization method*, called **solver** in scikit-learn and **optimizer** in the Keras API. The current trend favors the **stochastic gradient descent** (SGD) method, which has many variants. Though you may find in books or tutorials the variant `optimizer='rmsprop'`, we use here `optimizer='adam'`, which is faster.\n",

    "* *The number of iterations*, that is, the number of times every data unit passes through the network, is controlled in Keras with the parameter **epochs**. The default is `epochs=1`. In SGD, the units don't pass all at once, but in **random batches** (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *The batch size*. In the SGD method, the training data are randomly partitioned in batches in every iteration. The batches are tried one-by-one and the weights are modified every time that a batch is tried. The Keras default is `batch_size=32`. We don't change this in the examples of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *The learning rate*, which we have already found in gradient boosting models, is a parameter which rules how fast the adjustment of the weights is done. If it is too low, there is no convergence to the optimal solution. If it is too high, you can overshoot the optimal solution. Modern ML software allows setting an initial learning rate and decrease it as the learning process goes on. The Keras default is `learning_rate=0.001`.\n",

Instead, it relies on a specialized tensor library to do so. That library serves as the **backend** engine of Keras.\n",

In November 2023, Keras 3 came again multi-backend, the optional backends being TensorFlow, Torch and JAX (a new Google development).\n",

Another advantage is that the code written in Keras by a developer using TensorFlow can be reused without change by another developer using Torch. Even if Torch tensors and TensorFlow tensors are different types of objects in Python, Keras takes care of that, and input and output tensors appear as NumPy arrays, which is the only thing you have to manage in Keras.\n",

    "1. At every node of every tree, the **random forest** algorithm searches for the best split using a **random subset of features**. The number of features is controlled by the parameter `max_features`. We have used the default, which is the square root of the number of columns of the feature matrix (`max_features=sqrt`). This means, in this case, 28 features. Logic tells us that, by increasing `max_features`, we will improve the accuracy, but the learning process (the fit step) will get slower. Try some variations on this, to see how it works in practice. Do you think that using the default number of features here was a good choice?\n",

    "2. Develop a **gradient boosting classifier** for these data, extracted from the `xgboost` class `XGBClassifier()`. Take into account that, with hundreds of columns, a gradient boosting model may be much slower to train than a random forest model with the same tree size and number of trees. A model with 100 trees and a size similar to those shown in this example can take one hour to train (less with XGBoost), though you may find a speed-up by increasing the **learning rate**.\n",
