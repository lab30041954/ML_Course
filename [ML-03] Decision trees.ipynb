    "There are various ways to train a decision tree model. The top popular one is the **CART** (Classification And Regression Trees) algorithm. In scikit-learn, the subpackage `tree` provides the estimator classes `DecisionTreeRegressor()` and `DecisionTreeClassifier()`, both based on CART.\n",
    "\n",
    "At every decision node, there is a **split**, based on one of the features and a cutoff value. CART chooses at every node the **optimal split**, that minimizes the **loss**. In decision tree regressors, as in linear regression, the default loss is the **mean square error** (MSE). Other choices are available through the parameter `criterion`. \n",

    "Figure 1 shows a decision tree regressor, developed to predict the price of a house (see lecture ML-05). At every node, we find the number of data units (`samples`), the MSE (`squared_error`) and the predicted price (`value`), which is the average price in that leaf. The tree is optimal (meaning that it provides the minimum MSE) among those satisfying the conditions set by the arguments of `DecisionTreeRegressor()`. For every possible split, CART calculates the loss as the weighted average of the losses at the two branches, choosing the split that leads to the minimum loss. \n",

    "In scikit-learn decision tree classifiers, the default loss function is **Gini impurity measure**. Nevertheless, to present a more consistent approach to classification models along this course, we use everywhere the **average cross-entropy** (see lecture ML-01), which, in the class `DecisionTreeClassifier()`, is specified with the argument `criterion='entropy'`. Figure 2 shows a decision tree intended to be used in a spam filter (see the example of this lecture). At every leaf, you find the number of units (`samples`), the average cross-entropy (`entropy`) and the number of negative and positive units in that leaf (`value`), in alphabetical order, so negative comes first. As the predicted class probabilities in a leaf, the model takes the class proportions in that leaf. In a binary setting, we can say that the predicted score for a data unit is the proportion of positive units in the leaf where that unit falls. The tree is optimal in the sense that the overall average cross-entropy (the weighted average of the cross-entropies at the leaf nodes) is minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following exercises can help you to understand how this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Figure 1, the initial MSE is equal to 134,776.142. Calculate the final MSE as the weighted average of the MSE's in the four leaf nodes. Translate the MSE reduction into a R-squared value (what the method `.score()` would return for this model).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Check that the initial cross-entropy in Figure 2 is indeed 0.967. What is the final entropy, after the three splits? Remember that scikit-learn uses binary logs to calculate the cross-entropy. In Python, you get the binary log as `math.log(x, 2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In Figure 2, suppose that the split in the root node has already been performed. The second split will be the one that brings a greater reduction of the cross-entropy. Is this the leftt one (`x[15] <= 0.135`) or the right one (`x[26] <= 0.08`)?  "

Change the features matrix by: (a) dropping the three `cap_` features and (b) **binarizing** all the `word_` features, transforming every column into a dummy for the occurrence of the corresponding word, taking value 1 if the word occurs in the message and 0 otherwise. Based on this new features matrix, train two new spam filters, one based on a logistic regression model and the other one based on a decision tree model, using the binarized data set. Evaluate these new filters and compare them to those obtained before."
