    "In classification, the target is a categorical variable with a (typically small) collection of values, which we call **classes**. When the data collection is driven by the availability of data, it is not rare for the proportion of training units of one class to be significantly different from the proportion of units of the other classes. This is called **class imbalance**. Though it does not receive enough attention in learning materials, class imbalance is quite frequent in real-world applications. Examples are **credit scoring** and **fraud detection**. It also occurs in **direct marketing**, due to the low **conversion rates** usually achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify, let us assume a binary classification context, with two classes, positive and negative. Typically, class imbalance happens because the positive training units are much less frequent than the negative ones. Imbalance can be extreme in some applications. For instance, for fraud detection in credit card transactions, the proportion of fraudulent transactions is typically below 1%. \n",
    "\n",
    "In such a extreme situation, many recommended metrics for model evaluation don't make sense. The accuracy, for instance. The **total accuracy** value that we see in the evaluation report of a classification model is the weighted average of the accuracy in the positive class and the accuracy in the negative class. If the positive class is much smaller than the negative class, the accuracy in the positive class has practically no influence in the total accuracy. So, a model can have a very good total accuracy but a poor accuracy in the positive class. Moreover, it may be that the learning process pushes the model selection in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various approaches have been proposed to address the class imbalance problem. They constitute the so called **imbalanced learning**. This lecture is a short introduction to that methodology.\n"

    "A classification model predicts a set of **class probabilities** for every data unit. In scikit-learn, this is provided by the method `.predict_proba()`. In the default prediction, the predicted class is the one with the highest probability. In scikit-learn, this is what the method `.predict()` does. One way of dealing with class imbalance is to step back to the class probabilities, and use them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In binary classification, the two class probabilities are complementary, so we focus on the positive class probability, which we call **predictive score**. In terms of these scores, the default prediction consists in predicting as positive those units for which the score exceeds 0.5. One way of coping with imbalance is to lower this threshold to a value closer to the actual proportion of positive training units. This is simple and easy to manage under moderate class imbalance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, under extreme class imbalance, the predicted class may be too sensitive to small changes in the threshold. Because of this, and also because users find that the scores are more \"managerial\" that the binary prediction, using the scores in business is common practice, in particular in fields like credit scoring and fraud detection. Decisions may be based on the scores, without an explicit pre-specified threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scoring approach popped up in the preceding lecture, and it is illustrated again by the example of this lecture. Alternative approaches, based on resampling the training data, are explained below, though the practice is left for the homework."

    "There are two main approaches for companies to promote products and/or services: through **mass campaigns**, targeting a general indiscriminate public, or through **direct marketing**, targeting a specific set of contacts. Nowadays, in a global competitive world, positive responses to mass campaigns are typically very low. Alternatively, direct marketing focuses on targets that assumably will be keener to that specific product/service, making these campaigns more efficient. But the increasingly vast number of marketing campaigns has reduced their effect on the general public. Furthermore, economical pressures and competition has led marketing managers to invest on direct campaigns with a strict and rigorous selection of contacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ten years ago, due to the internal competition and the current financial crisis, there were huge pressures for European banks to increase their financial assets. One strategy is to offer attractive **long-term deposit** applications with good interest rates, in particular through direct marketing. A Portuguese institution had been offering term deposits to its clients for the last two years, but in a way that the board finds disorganized and inefficient. Too many contacts were made for the subscriptions obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bank had been using its own contact-center to carry out direct marketing campaigns. The telephone was the dominant marketing channel, sometimes with the help of the Internet online banking channel (*e.g*. by showing information to a specific targeted client). Furthermore, each campaign was managed in an integrated fashion and the results for all channels were outputted together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manager in charge of the next campaign was expected to optimize the effort. His objective was to derive, from the data of the preceding campaign  a **predictive model** for the success of a contact, *i.e*. whether the client subscribes the deposit. That model would increase the campaign's efficiency by identifying the main characteristics that affected success, helping in a better management of the available resources (*e.g*. human effort, phone calls and time) and the selection of a high quality and affordable set of potential clients. To be useful for the direct campaign, a predictive model must allow reducing the number of calls in a relevant way, without losing a relevant number of subscribers."
