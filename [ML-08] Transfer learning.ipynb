    "**Transfer learning** is a technique used in machine learning to leverage the knowledge gained from one task to improve the performance on another related task. This typically involves taking a model that has been pre-trained on a big data set and adapting it for the new task, by updating the model's parameter values with new data, specific for the new task. The data set used in this updating step is typically much smaller than the pre-training data set, which allows us to save money and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning is critical in domains where data are only available in small amounts, or would be very expensive to collect. Since big data sets are needed to scape overfitting with complex models, transfer learning is common practice in many real-world applications. In both **computer vision** and in **natural language processing**, we can profit from existing models that have been released by their developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning has two components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The pre-trained model. These models are usually extracted from public repositories, called **hubs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The new data. These data have to be specific of the new task, called the **downstream task**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When can transfer learning help you? When you can find a pre-trained model with the same kind of inputs, and there is a commonality in the tasks of the two models. It makes a difference because, when training a neural network model from scratch, we start with random parameter values. These initial values don't make any sense for the task on which we are training the model. Starting with the parameter values learned in a previous training, we are much closer to the optimal values."

    "In the context of this lecture, who would say that it is the pre-trained model. We can see it as composed of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **convolutional base**, a stack of three `Conv2D` layers and two `MaxPooling2D` layers. This part encodes the image as a vector of length 576. This transformation is called an **embedding** (see next lecture). Because of the pretraining, the embedding generates features that are appropriate for recognizing shapes and corners.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **top classifier**, which is like an MLP model with a hidden layer of 64 nodes whose input is a vector of length 576. The `Flatten` layer does not have any parameter, so it can be included in this part or in the base. This top part classifies the embedding vectors as digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that we switch from digit recognition to letter recognition. Our model can be based on the same network architecture, except for the last `Dense` layer, which will be adapted so that it will ouptput 26 class probabilities (English alphabet) instead of 10. If we consider that the convolutional base, as it is, is also good for the new task, we can freeze the parameter values of that part, and train only the classifier. In practice, it would be as if we were using the embedding vectors produced by the convolutional base as the features for a classification model. Then, instead of transfer learning, we could call this feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also unfreeze part of the convolutional base (*e.g*. the last `Conv2D` layer), or the whole thing, modifying so the parameter values. This is called  **fine-tuning**, because, even if the parameter values change, they don't change much. We will see in the following example how easy are these tricks in Keras."

    "Now, the hidden layers. As in the preceding lecture we stack convolutional blocks (`Conv2D` plus `MaxPooling2D`). Since we are dealing with bigger images, we make the network larger, including a fourth block. The depth of the feature maps progressively increases in the network (from 32 to 128), while the size decreases (from 150 $\\times$ 150 to 7 $\\times$ 7). As we will see in the summary below, flattening the output of the fourth convolutional block leaves us with a tensor of length 6,272, so we reduce the dimensionality with a final `Dense` layer. This last layer returns a vector of length 512 which is expected to provide a representation of the image that helps the dogs vs cats classification.

The model **VGG16** is a (relatively) simple CNN model with a convolutional base made of `Conv2D` and `MaxPooling2D` layers. Importing this model is straightforward."

    "1. `keras.applications` offers plenty of choice for pre-trained models, beyond VGG16. `https://keras.io/api/applications` can help you to choose. For instance, you can try **Xception**, which uses some additional tricks proposed by F Chollet.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Transfer learning is the broad concept of reusing a pre-trained model for a new, related task, while **fine-tuning** is a specific, advanced type of transfer learning where you unfreeze some or all layers of the pre-trained model and retrain them on new data for better adaptation. In this example, you can easily unfreeze some of the last layers of the pre-trained model. For instance, after freezing all the layers of the the VGG16 model with `conv_base.trainable = False`, you can apply the loop `for l in conv_base.layers[-2]: l.trainable = True`. For the training process to work, you will have to decrease the **learning rate** (the default is `learning_rate=1e-3`). To do this, import first the module `optimizers` (`from keras import optimizers`), and then compile the model using the argument `optimizer=optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=5e-5)`.\n",

    "4. If you have survived to the preceding exercises, you can play with the learning rate, to see how this affects the fitting process."
