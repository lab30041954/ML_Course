    "The objective of **artificial intelligence** (AI) is create agents that perform certain tasks in an \"intelligent\" way. An **AI agent** can be something physical, like a robot that sweeps the floor, or a software app, like a model that classifies the potential customers of a lending institution as good or bad creditors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine learning** (ML) takes place when the AI agent learns from data how to perform its task. We operationalize the learning process as follows. We design a **model**, which can be as simple as a single equation, or as complex as **Gemini 3.0**. The model has a set of **parameters**. The number of parameters can be high (more than one trillion in some large language models), so it is often unclear what their specific role is. Then the learning process consists in using the data to find the **optimal values** for the parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of talking about \"learning\", a statistician would say that he is **fitting** the model to the data, or **estimating** the parameters of the model. This terminology is used in one of the **Python** libraries used in this course, **scikit-learn**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the optimal parameter values is also called **training**. The data used for training the model are then the **training data**. A major issue with training a model is that the parameter values that are optimal on the training data may be suboptimal on data that have not been involved in the training, so that the model underperforms in real applications. This is the **overfitting** problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the potential overfitting, the model is tested on different data, which are then called **test data**. This is **model validation**. Validation is needed for models whose complexity allows them to overfit the data. Overfitting is a fact of life for many ML algorithms, *e.g*. for those used to develop **neural network models**. So, validation is integrated in the learning process for these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is restricted to **supervised learning**. Roughly speaking, this is what the statisticians call **prediction**, that is, the description of one variable ($Y$) in terms of other variables (the $X$'s). In the ML context, $Y$ is called the **target**, and the $X$'s are called the **features**. The units (they can be customers, products, etc) on which the features and the target are observed are called **samples** (this term has a different meaning in statistics).\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **regression** applies to the prediction of a (more or less continuous) numeric target, and the term **classification** to the prediction of a categorical target. In **binary classification**, there are only two target values or **classes**, while, in **multi-class classification**, there can be three or more. A **classifier**, or classification model, predicts a probability for every class.\n",

    "The Python library scikit-learn (`sklearn` in the code) is a machine learning toolkit, built on top of thed libraries NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib, which comes as a package with many subpackages. To get an idea of the hierarchy and these subpackages, the best source is the **scikit-learn API Reference** (`scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html`). Some of them are used in this course: `linear_model`, `tree`, `metrics`, `ensemble`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subpackages that we use for supervised learning contain a collection of **estimator classes**, which allow us to create and apply predictive models. In this course, we use a number of these classes: `LinearRegression()`, `LogisticRegression()`, `DecisionTreeClassifier()`, etc. In Python, a **class** is like an object constructor, or a \"blueprint\" for creating objects. Even if they may look intimidating at first sight, it is very easy, in practice, to pick a class from a Python package and create an object of that class, as you will see in the examples of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with scikit-learn, you may get a **warning** from time to time. Note that a warning is not the same as an **error message**. An error message stops the execution of your command, while a warning does not. Most of the warnings will tell you nothing of interest, but a few ones contain relevant information, so it is recommended to take a look at them with the corner of your eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a supervised learning method in scikit-learn, you have to specify a (1D) **target vector** `y` and a (2D) **feature matrix** `X`. In regression, both `X` and `y` have to be of numeric or Boolean type, but, in classification, `y` can be a string vector. Both NumPy arrays and Pandas data containers are accepted, but the scikit-learn methods always return NumPy arrays."

For instance, if you have a 90% of negative training units, classifying all the training units as negative gives you 90% accuracy (you don't need machine learning for that!).\n",

Their advantage is that they are still valid when the proportion of positives in the training data has been artificially inflated, because they are calculated separately on the actual positives and the actual negatives. This may look strange, but it is common practice under class imbalance. When the proportion of positives is inflated, the training data cannot be taken as representative of any population, and the accuracy derived from the confusion matrix cannot be extrapolated to the real world.\n"

For every data unit, the cross-entropy is the negative logarithm of the predicted class probability of the actual class of that unit. scikit-learn uses binary logs, as in information theory, but other libraries, like **Keras**, use natural logs. You should not be concerned by this, because you don't really use these cross-entropy values, they are just part of mathematical apparatus.\n",

The iterative process goes on until the loss falls below a certain **tolerance** or until a **maximum number of iterations** has been attained. Then we say that the process has achieved **convergence**. When the feature scales are diverse, this process is slower, and the number of iterations needed to converge is higher.

    "In scikit-learn, irrespective of the type of estimator, three basic methods, namely `.fit()`, `.predict()` and `.score()`, are available. The method `.fit()` performs the training, that is, it searches for the parameter values that work best for the data. In practice, this means those values for which the loss (the average cross-entropy) is minimum."

    "1. In this data set, there is a mix of scales, which can be visualized with the method `.describe()`. This mix slowns down the convergence in the  method `.fit()`, so we had to increase the parameter `max_iter`. This is not a relevant issue in a model as simple as the one used in this example, but it will be in the complex models that will appear later in this course, such as the **neural network models**. Try different values for `max_iter` in the specification of the `LogisticRegression()` and examine how the maximum number of iterations affects the model accuracy in this case.\n",

Assume that the Omicron management plans to offer a **20% discount** to the customers that the model classifies as potential churners, and that this offer is going to have a 100% success, so the company will retain all the churners detected. Evaluate the benefit produced by this **retention policy** with the two models presented in this example.\n",
