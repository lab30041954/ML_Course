    "\n",
    "    + **Translation**. The output text is a translation of the input text to another language. Automatic translation from Russian to English is one of the very classics of artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    + **Named entity recognition** (NER). The input is a text together with a collection of entities. The output is a list of the entities found in the text. For instance, the model can extract a dish name from a restaurant review.\n",

    "Even if the data unit in NLP is a string, that string is not processed as a whole, but previously split in a list of substrings called **tokens**. The extraction of tokens from the input text is called **tokenization**. Tokenization is one of the oldest problems in NLP, and different approaches have been discussed for years: words, sub-words, pairs of words, etc. Also, tokenization is a harder problem in some languages, like Spanish and French, with many verb forms, or in German, with its declensions, prefixes and suffixes, than in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays, the debate about the tokenization level has lost interest for the practitioners). First, there is plenty of supply of tokenization models, called **tokenizers**. Second, all the relevant LLM's come with their own tokenizers, so you don't have to think about them once you have chosen your model. In these models, most of the tokens are words, and a small proportion of subwords. Also, punctuation marks can be tokens. In addition to all these, there is an \"unknown\" token (the vocabulary of the model is limited), a token for the start of the text and another token for the end. So, when we input a string to one of these models, it is converted to a list of tokens, though we never see them in practice."

    "The first segment of a transformer is always a tokenizer, specific for the model. The tokenizer comes with a **token dictionary** and a list of embedding vectors of a given length, one for each token. When we prompt a string, the string is split in a list of tokens, and the corresponding vectors are packed as a matrix, with a token embedding vector in each row. So, the input in a transformer is, properly speaking, a 2D array, not a text. This implies that, even if the original transformer was designed with an NLP perspective, in the transformer, as in any model based on a neural network architecture, the input and the output are tensors. As a matter of fact, transformers have also been applied in computer vision (they are a serious challenge to CNN models).\n",
    "\n",
    "The three differential components of the transformer are briefly explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At the beginning, a **positional embedding** are used to give the model information about the position of each token in the input text or, more specifically, the row number in the input 2D array. The positional embedding generates a different vector for every row. These vectors are added to the input token vector. This is a way of encoding the order of the tokens (and punctuation) in the text, which is one of the ingredients of the \"meaning\". \n",
    "\n",
    "* The mid part of the transformer is a combo of common **feedforweard layers** (those that compose an MLP network) and **attention layes**. The attention layer is a transformation that replaces every token vector by a weighted average of all token vectors. The weights are based on the similarity among the token vectors. A simple example may help to understand the role of attention. Suppose that word 'bank' comes in the sentence 'I got money from the bank'. The attention mechanism changes the vector that stands for 'bank' by pushing it toward the vector that stands for money. So, 'bank' gets a more \"financial\" meaning. This is the way in which the attention mechanism captures the meaning of a word from the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "* At the end, the output layer is the same as in the classification neural networks that we have seen in this course, but the predicted token is not always the one with the maximum probability. Instead it is randomly chosen according to the predicted class (token) probabilities. For instance, if the model predicts a probability 0.4 for a certain token, that token will be chosen 40% of the time. The softmax activation is also slightly modified, with an additional parameter called **temperature**. This controls the randomness of the prediction of the next token. In mathematical terms, the token probabilities are calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_i = \\frac{\\exp(z_i/t)}{\\exp(z_1/t) + \\cdots + \\exp(z_m/t)}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With $t = 1$, the next token probabilities are calculated with the ordinary softmax function. With $t = 0$, the probability is equal to 1 for the token for which $z_i$ is maximum, and 0 for the rest. So, there is no randomness at all, and, for a given input, the model will predict always the same token."
